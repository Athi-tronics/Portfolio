# References & Testimonials

This folder hosts **third-party testimonials, recommendation letters, or reference notes** that corroborate my work. Files are **sanitised** for public sharing (no phone numbers or personal emails unless explicitly public).

## Evidence (examples)
- 📄 `2024_Glencore_Technical_Manager_Testimonial.pdf`
- 📄 `2022_VWSA_Supervisor_Reference.pdf`
- 🖼️ `2025_LinkedIn_Recommendation_[Name].png` (screenshot of LinkedIn recommendation with URL in caption)

> **Naming convention:** `YEAR_ORIGIN_PERSONROLE_Testimonial.ext` (e.g., `2024_Glencore_TechMgr_Testimonial.pdf`).

## Redaction & consent
- Remove personal contact details (phone/email/ID). Keep **name & title** only (or initials if required).
- If a document contains sensitive internal info (pricing, plant tags, incident details), **black it out** before uploading.
- Prefer **PDF** or **PNG**; export at ~150–200 dpi to keep files small (<20 MB).

## How recruiters should use this folder
- Treat these as **character and delivery signals** that complement the evidence in `/projects` and `/experience`.
- If direct contact is needed, I can supply **full referee contact details on request**.
